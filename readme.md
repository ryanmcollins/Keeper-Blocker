#Keeper Blocker

##Summary

At it's most basic, this blocks MacKeeper pages from loading. 

Keeper Blocker is meant to be installed on Safari browsers to block webpages matching the regular expression 'mackeeper\.(com|net|org)'. I personally created this to install on friends and relatives Safari's to prevent the need to answer the question "Do I need this?" or to end up wasting half a day on removal efforts after the tragedy.

##Use

Install on Safari to block pages which match 'mackeeper\.(com|net|org)'
